# Create a SQLite database from CSVs with Python

The program is for building a database in SQLite by importing csv files downloaded from Bank of America (BoA) with python.

After moving into a new place, I decided to set up an account book for self-review. To keep my finances organized and up-to-date, 
I wrote a program that automates the process. To use it, simply download the CSV file of the latest statement and save it to the "boa" folder 
in the same directory. Then run the program step-by-step. I hope this program is helpful for you.

# Shopping Decisions Analysis

The program, payment_analysis, analyzes the transactions recorded in the SQLite database with python.

Recording financial transactions can help us better understand our own financial status. By keeping an account book, we can track our income and 
expenses and make more informed decisions based on the data.

This is just one example of what Python is capable of! There are countless other applications and possibilities with this versatile programming language.
